## Ok, but for real, what is this?

This is a clock that displays the current time in Matei Standard Time (MST), an inside joke from one of my friends groups. Details on [the website](https://mst.matei.lol).

## Why?

I was curious to see just how much design, coding and work I could do frontend-wise in less than an hour. 90% of this project (i.e. the initial commit) was done in less than 1 hour,
with friends to prove the session. I'm quite happy with how much I came up with and managed to do in an hour, given I don't think of myself as a frontend person.

I also didn't know Astro beforehand, so it was fun to try out.
